# Stardew Farmers Only

A simple Stardew Valley mod that allows you to specialize in a set of particular skills and receive no levels in other skills.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This mod recommends [Chat Commands](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2092) to configure it in game, otherwise you can use the configuration commands below as console commands in the SMAPI window.

### Configuring the mod

Use the following console commands:

* /list_skill - Lists your currently specialized skill
* /set_skill <Farming,Mining,Foraging,Fishing,Combat> - Sets your specialized skills, you may select multiple using a comma separated list

This should persist between loads after saving your game, and let you know when you load which skill you are specialized in.

## Known Issues

* When sleeping after leveling up a non-specialized skill, it appears you still level up in that skill but when looking at your actual skills in-game you'll notice it's still empty.

## Version History

* 0.1
    * Initial Release
